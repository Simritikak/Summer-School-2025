What is Greedy Algorithm?
	A Greedy Algorithm is an approach for solving problems by making the locally optimal
	choice at each step, with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally
	optimal solution.
	
	In other words:
		- Take the best possible choice at the current moment -- repeat -- untill the problem
			is solved.
			
	Gready choice property:
		- The problem has the Greedy choice property.
		- The problem has Optimal Substructure.
		- You need an efficient solution (usually faster than brute force or dp).
		
	Optimal Substructure:
		A problem has an optimal solution that contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
		

Example:
	1. You're give a list of activities with start and end time array. Select the max
	number of activities that don't overlap.
	
	- Always pick the activity that finishes earliest.
